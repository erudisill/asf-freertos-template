ASF Based FreeRTOS Template for SAM4S
=====================================
A basic template for FreeRTOS with ASF targeted for a SAM4S.
Uses Eclipse and the ARM CDT plugin.
CPH-BOARD is just a stub. Fill it out with proper pin definitions and constants.
Stay away from the GPIO driver since it's deprecated (although some ASF libraries seem to still be dependent on it.)
